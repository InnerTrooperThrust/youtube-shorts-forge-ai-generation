# Security Policy

## Design Principles

Security in ShortForge is achieved through **isolation, minimalism, and transparency**:
- All AI models and assets are bundled locally — no remote dependencies
- No runtime code loading or plugin auto-update mechanisms
- Video rendering uses hardened FFmpeg with input sanitization

## Binary Integrity

- Windows releases are signed with an Extended Validation (EV) certificate
- macOS releases are notarized by Apple
- Linux packages include SHA256 checksums for verification

## Threat Model

ShortForge assumes:
- The host operating system is trusted
- User input (prompts) is sanitized before processing
- Generated content does not execute code (output is static MP4)

We do not protect against physical access or OS-level compromise.

## Reporting Issues

For security vulnerabilities, contact:  
**security@yourdomain.com**

Do not disclose issues publicly until coordinated disclosure is complete.
